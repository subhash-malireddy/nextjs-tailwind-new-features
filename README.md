## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.

## I use this repo to explore latest next.js and tailwind features. 
- For example explore the [global.css](https://github.com/subhash-malireddy/nextjs-tailwind-new-features/blob/a2d9fee72a980bafab994fdc5072d08cbfed0892/app/ui/global.css) and [tailwind.config.ts](https://github.com/subhash-malireddy/nextjs-tailwind-new-features/blob/a2d9fee72a980bafab994fdc5072d08cbfed0892/tailwind.config.ts) to get an idea about how I setup the dark and light theme without using any third party libraries.
    - This can be extended with n number of themes,
    - user choice can be saved to a db,
    - can simply use design tokens(tokens in FIGMA, css variables/custom-properties in code if necessary.
